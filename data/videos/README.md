Place FOLDERS here. The folders must have this naming structure: '0xx-CLASSNAME', where xx is a double digit class id that can begin with 0. You could use 0xxx as a class id, but make sure that the first three digits are 0 if the class id is a single digit. Inside these folders, place .MOV files of an object of that class with any file name. The video MUST be a video of an object rotating on an electric turntable for at least a minute, where the first frame shows the turntable without any objects. The first 5 seconds after the first frame are ignored, so you can use that time to place the object on the table with your hands without your hands being present in the generated photos.
