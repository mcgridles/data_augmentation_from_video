Place .MOV files here. The following format must be used: classid-classname.MOV, and additional videos of the same class (to get different viewing angles) should be named classid-num-classname.MOV. The videos MUST be of objects rotating on an electric turntable for at least a minute, where the first frame shows the turntable without any objects. The first 5 seconds after the first frame are ignored, so you can use that time to place the object on the table with your hands without your hands being present in the generated photos.
